##Scenario: 

Imagine you're at a coffee shop, and you want to order a cup of coffee with various add-ons and customizations, such as extra flavors, whipped cream, or different types of milk. The coffee shop's menu offers a base set of beverages, and customers can customize them with additional toppings or modifications.

##Decorator Pattern Implementation:

The Decorator pattern allows for the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without modifying their existing code. It achieves this by providing a way to "wrap" objects within objects of similar interface.

#Base Beverage Class: 
The base class represents the core beverage options available at the coffee shop, such as "Coffee," "Espresso," or "Latte."
#Decorator Classes: 
Decorator classes represent additional options or modifications that customers can add to their base beverage. Each decorator class adds specific features or ingredients to the beverage.
#Concrete Beverage Classes: 
Concrete beverage classes extend the base beverage class and represent specific beverage options available on the menu, such as "House Blend Coffee" or "Cappuccino."

#Example Usage:

Let's say you order a "House Blend Coffee" from the coffee shop. You have the option to customize your coffee by adding different decorators, such as "Whipped Cream," "Vanilla Flavor," or "Soy Milk."
Each decorator class modifies the base beverage object (in this case, the "House Blend Coffee") by adding its specific feature or ingredient.
For example, if you add the "Whipped Cream" decorator, it wraps the "House Blend Coffee" object and adds whipped cream on top of the coffee.

##Benefits of Decorator Pattern:

#Dynamic Customization: 
The Decorator pattern allows for dynamic customization of objects by adding or removing features at runtime. Customers can customize their beverages according to their preferences.

#Extensibility: 
New decorator classes can be easily added to introduce additional customization options without modifying existing code. This makes the system flexible and adaptable to changes in customer preferences or menu offerings.

#Separation of Concerns: 
Decorator classes separate the concerns of base beverage functionality and additional features, promoting code organization and maintainability.
